# Australian Eyewear Market 2023-2030: Market Size, Growth and Trends



Over the past decade, the Australian eyewear market has grown significantly due to various factors such as fashion trend changes, aging of the population, increased screen time, and other technological advancements. This market is expected to continue growing in 2023 with the wide variety of products that it will offer, including prescription glasses, sunglasses, contact lenses, and new smart eye-wear technologies.

# Market Size and Growth Trends

The Australian eyewear market is estimated to rise to around AUD 2.5 billion by 2023 from nearly AUD 2 billion in 2018, with a CAGR of approximately 3-4% in the five years. This growth will be sustained by increased consumer awareness regarding eye health and supported by fashion-conscious customers and new technological advancements within eyewear products.

# Segmentation

Prescriptive glasses presently represent the largest percentage of the market. For a large part of the population, prescription eyeglasses are essential. Demand for prescription eyewear is healthy due to the baby boomer generation with graying age and myopia amongst the young people of this generation because of extensive hours spent on computers and smartphones.

Sunglasses: This is a significant category once again because of the sunny climate in Australia, and consumer awareness about UV radiation damage. This segment is highly influenced by fashion trends; therefore, many customers have more than one pair for different styles to wear at different occasions.

Contact Lenses: Demand has developed due to the continuous process of developing more comfortable, convenient lenses. The use of daily disposables and specialized lenses for various problems, such as astigmatism and presbyopia, has further expanded the user group using contact lenses.

Smart Eyewear: Smart eyewear, such as AR glasses and fitness-trackers integrated into sunglasses, is finding increasing traction, although it still has yet to break out from the niche category. This kind of innovation should be targeting more tech-savvy consumers and early adopters.

# Key Players

The Australian eyewear market has a mix of international brands with operations in the country, as well as local companies. These include Luxottica Group, owner of Ray-Ban and Oakley brands; Specsavers; OPSM; and Bailey Nelson. These leading companies overflow both retail and wholesale segments with a wide array of products targeting different price points and consumer preferences.

# Consumer Trends and Behaviors

Fashion and Personalization: Eyewear has transformed from a commodity with a purely utilitarian usage to a fashion accessory. The customer is increasingly looking for distinctive styles and personalization, hence driving demand for bespoke or tailored and customizable eyewear.

Health Awareness: With increased awareness about health in general and eye health in particular, partly through education campaigns by health organizations, regular eye check-ups have become common, early detection of eye conditions is on the rise, and this drives the prescription eyewear segment.

Digital Eye Fatigue: An increase in remote work and, consequently, digital device usage has resulted in increased cases of digital eye strain. As a result, the demand for blue light blocking glasses and lenses that would help reduce eye fatigue experienced a hike.

Sustainability: Conscious consumers are starting to show demand for sustainable eyewear. Brands offering products created from recycled or biodegradable materials are gaining popularity.

# Impact of Technology

Technology has been playing a vital role in changing the face of the eyewear market:

E-commerce has made it easier for consumers to buy eyewear online. Virtual try-on technologies using augmented reality enable customers to see how frames look on their faces, reducing the hesitation associated with online purchases.

Teleoptometry: Remote eye examinations and consultations have gained much momentum in recent times, particularly post-pandemic COVID-19. This allows access to eye care services even in remote areas.

Improved Lenses: The innovation in lenses, such as progressive lenses, anti-reflective coatings, and transition lenses, provides a superior viewing experience to the consumers and influences them to upgrade their eyewear.

Regulatory Environment

The Australian eyewear industry is also covered by legislation that provides for consumer safety and ensures good quality products. The TGA also regulates the medical devices used within the industry, including contact lenses. Then there is the professional obligation of the optical dispensers and optometrists who must adhere to organizations such as the Optometry Board of Australia.


# Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic had a mixed effect on the eyewear market. While the number of retail visits declined during the pandemic due to multiple lockdowns in several countries, online eyewear sales experienced significant growth. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of tele-optometry services and underlined the importance of digital channels to engage customers. Supply chain disruptions affected the inventory levels initially, but companies have adapted themselves since then by diversifying their sources of supply.

# Challenges and Opportunities
Competition: In general, competition has grown, especially with the emergence of online optical stores, both domestic and international. This is countered by brick-and-mortar stores as they enhance in-store experiences and ensure omnichannel services.

Price Sensitivity: All in all, there is an increased propensity of consumers being price-sensitive and seeking value-for-money products. This trend benefits discount retailers and challenges premium brands to justify higher price points by ensuring quality and service.

Aging Population: Increasingly large numbers of people within the elderly bracket provide opportunities for products aimed at age-related vision problems, such as presbyopia and cataracts.

Customization and Niche Markets: Brands positioned in select niches, such as sports-specific eyewear or eyewear for kids, can capitalize on such underserved segments.

# Outlook
The Australian eyewear market will continue to grow. Factors that will shape the future of the industry include:

Integration of Technology: Smart eyewear will continue to be more acceptable due to technology development and reduced prices. More integration with smartphones and other devices will add to their functionality.

Sustainability Initiatives: Eco-friendly products and practices will be more in demand. Companies manufacturing with sustainable materials and ethical production will appeal to this growing environmental awareness of consumers.

Personalized Marketing: Data analytics and AI will also enable companies to offer personalized recommendations and marketing messages for improved customer engagement and sales conversions.

Healthcare Collaboration: Collaboration between eyewear retailers and healthcare providers will enhance their services with comprehensive eye health packages, including disease screenings for glaucoma and macular degeneration.
